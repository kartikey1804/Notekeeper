# Notekeeper Application - README  

## Project Overview  

**Notekeeper** is a note-taking web application inspired by **Google Keep**, designed for managing and organizing notes efficiently. It includes features like adding, editing, and pinning notes, with a focus on aesthetic design, functionality, and originality.  

---

## Features  

1. **Add Notes**  
   - Users can create notes with a **title**, **tagline**, and **body**.  
   - Notes are displayed in a **grid layout** on the main page.  

2. **Edit Notes**  
   - Clicking on a note opens it in a **pop-up modal** where users can edit its content.  

3. **Pin Notes**  
   - Notes can be **pinned** to stay at the top of the list, regardless of their creation or last-edit date.  

4. **Pagination**  
   - The application implements **pagination** to display a maximum of **6 notes per page**.  

5. **Shared Access**  
   - No sign-in is required; multiple users can add, view, and edit notes.  

6. **Error Handling**  
   - Errors are handled gracefully with **toast notifications** or **pop-ups**, avoiding intrusive alerts.
